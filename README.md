# Optimal Control via Dynamic Programing

Goal: Solve 

```
						minimize J(x,u,t) = g(x(0),x(T)) + ∫_0_T_[f(x,u,t)]dt
							s.t. dx/dt=h(x,u,t) (dynamics)
								x_min <= x <= x_max (bounded state values)
								u_min <= u <= u_max (bounded control values)
```
whre x is the state variable, u is the control variable
